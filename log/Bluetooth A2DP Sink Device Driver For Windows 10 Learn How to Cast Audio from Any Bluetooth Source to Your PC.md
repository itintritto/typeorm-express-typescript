Bluetooth A2DP Sink Device Driver is a software that allows you to use your Windows 10 PC as a wireless speaker for your Bluetooth audio source device, such as your smartphone or tablet. With this driver, you can stream music from your Bluetooth device to your PC and enjoy high-quality sound.
 
However, Windows 10 does not support the A2DP sink role by default. This means you cannot receive audio from other Bluetooth devices via A2DP unless you enable it manually. In this article, we will show you how to enable and use Bluetooth A2DP Sink Device Driver on Windows 10 with some simple steps.
