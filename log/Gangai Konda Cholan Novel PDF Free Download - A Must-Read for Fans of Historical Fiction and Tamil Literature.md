One of the most remarkable achievements of Rajendra Chola I was his overseas expedition to Southeast Asia. In 1025 CE, Rajendra led Chola forces across the Indian Ocean and invaded Srivijaya, a powerful maritime kingdom that controlled the trade routes between India and China. Rajendra attacked several places in Malaysia and Indonesia, such as Kadaram (the capital), Pannai, Malaiyur, Tambralinga, and Gangga Nagara. He also captured many ships and prisoners from Srivijaya and its allies. Rajendra's naval campaign was a display of his military prowess and his ambition to dominate the Indian Ocean trade. He also brought back a lot of wealth and tribute from the conquered lands, which he used to enrich his empire and patronize art and culture.
 
Rajendra Chola I was not only a great warrior but also a great builder. He constructed many temples, irrigation tanks, roads, and forts throughout his empire. He also founded a new capital city called Gangai Konda Cholapuram, which means "the city of the Chola who took the Ganges". The city was named after his victorious march to the north of India, where he defeated the Pala king Mahipala and reached the banks of the Ganges river. Rajendra built a magnificent Shiva temple in his new capital, which is considered one of the finest examples of Chola architecture. The temple has a towering vimana (pyramidal tower) that rises to a height of 55 meters (180 feet). The temple also has many sculptures and inscriptions that depict Rajendra's achievements and glory.
